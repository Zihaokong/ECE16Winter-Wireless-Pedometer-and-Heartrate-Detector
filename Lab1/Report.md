## **Objective 2**
1. _The objective is to get familiar with Arduino._
2. _The step includes use delay and digitalWrite to blink the LED on Arduino_

## **Objective 3**
1. _The objective is to use a button with pull up resistor, make a stop watch and make a toggle._
2. _Step to make a stop watch_
	* Wire things together, 
	* Divide button into two states, when button is off and when button is on
   
   _Step to make a toggle switch_
	* create two states with mode 1 and 2
	* if state is low zero the counter
	* print different stuff and change state
	* every Time it prints, increase counter, and make isPRess false

## **Objective 4**
1. Learn Github and Git terminal
2. Learn how to write MarkDown
